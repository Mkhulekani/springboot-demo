# Spring Boot User Management Demo

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly **Spring Boot** application that demonstrates:
- Core Spring concepts: annotations, dependency injection, and inversion of control.
- Layered MVC architecture using model, repository, and service components.
- Unit testing with JUnit 5.
- Git version control with a Gitflow-based workflow.

This version uses an in-memory repository to simulate database operations, making it ideal for learning and prototyping.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Gradle**
- **JUnit 5**

## ðŸ”§ How to Run the App

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mkhulekani/springboot-demo.git
cd spring-boot-user-demo


## ðŸ§° How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-user-demo.git
cd spring-boot-user-demo

2. ðŸ§° How to Run Application
./gradlew bootRun

3. Youâ€™ll see printed output in the console from service interactions.

âœ… How to Test
To execute unit tests:
./gradlew test

ðŸ“Œ Features Implemented

âœ… MVC Layered Architecture
âœ… Constructor-based Dependency Injection (@Autowired)
âœ… Spring Boot annotations: @SpringBootApplication, @Override, etc.
âœ… In-memory data handling via custom repository
âœ… Clean, testable, and modular code
âœ… Gitflow workflow for collaborative development

ðŸ§ª Code Quality & Testing Standards
Descriptive commit messages using types: feat, fix, test, docs
Follows Java naming conventions and OOP principles (encapsulation, abstraction)
Includes unit tests for edge cases and method accuracy
Uses constructor injection instead of direct instantiation

ðŸŒ± Gitflow Branching Strategy
Branch	Purpose
main	Production-ready code
develop	Integration of new features
feature/*	Individual features
test	Pre-merge test validation

Workflow Example:

git checkout -b feature/add-user-service
git commit -m "feat: add user service implementation"
git push origin feature/add-user-service
